# React.js Form Validation Sample

This is a sample React.js project created with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to implement form validation in a React application.

### Key Features

- **Form Fields:** The project includes two form fields: email and password.

- **Form Validation:** It demonstrates how to validate form inputs in real-time using React state and display error messages when there are validation errors.

- **Password Visibility:** For the password field, there's an option to toggle the password's visibility, allowing users to see the entered password.

- **Form Submission:** The project logs form submissions to the console when all input fields are correctly filled out.

### Usage

You can use this sample project as a reference for implementing form validation in your own React applications. Explore the code to understand how validation logic is applied and how form components are structured.

Feel free to modify and extend this project to suit your specific form validation requirements.
